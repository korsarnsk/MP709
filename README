make

Two ways to execute:

1. get a list of available mp709 devices
sudo ./mp709

2. turn <device_number> on|off
sudo ./mp709 on|off <device_number>

p.s.
I tried to use the following implementation
https://github.com/radistmorse/mp709
it uses hidapi library
https://github.com/signal11/hidapi

But I failed to use it with CentOS 6 and Ubuntu 14.04 because of it worked unstable and process hanged up very often.

That's why I did a fork from very simple implementation https://github.com/sergei-svistunov/MP709, which is based on file operations with devices. It works very stable and solves my task completely.

p.p.s
If somebody still want to use https://github.com/signal11/hidapi and get an error during linking (don't remember exact wording, but something about libtool and inability to link), to resolve the issue try to run ./configure --with-gnu-ld then re-compile again.
